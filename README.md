# dimensionality-reduction
In this part, you are expected to conduct dimensionality reduction on three biomedical data files (pca_a.txt, pca_b.txt, pca_c.txt), which can be found on Piazza. In each file, each row represents the record of a patient/sample; the last column is the disease name, and the rest columns are features. Note that your code should be able to handle the data with different numbers of rows/columns.
